## Installation
1. Update your own logo
2. Update index.php to have your info in the header and footer
3. Upload all files to your server (probably in a folder called invoice)
4. go to your.domain/invoice/admin.php and follow the prompts

Creating your admin user will create a login.php file with username encrypted password for future logins.

The script should automatically create a data.json file with permissions set to 600 so people can't just look at all your stuff ;)


## Enjoy
