# Invoice-System
Create, update, and track invoices on the fly

## Installation
Update your own logo
Update index.php to have your info in the header and footer
Upload all files to your server (probably in a folder called invoice)
go to your.domain/invoice/admin.php and follow the prompts

the script should automatically create a data.json file with permissions set to 600 so people can't just look at all your stuff ;)

## Enjoy
